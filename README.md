# Python-Acronym-Generator

I wrote a program that creates acronyms using Python.

This program is useful or organizations that want to create a short and memorable name for their groups. Such as NASA (Norh American Space Agency) 

This program is also useful for popular culuture. Such as turning ASAP into As soon as possible. G2G: Got to go, TTYL: Talk to you later and IMO: In my opinion
